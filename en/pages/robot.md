# Robotics project
## Academic context
I realized this project with Yijue Xie for the course *Sensors for intelligent systems*. We had to choose and realize a task with a Turltebot equipped with LiDAR, Camera, infrared, IMU, odometer.

Our objective was to let the robot find its target, move towards the target and round it..

## Results
You can find our codes and the documentation (in french only) on this [Gitlab repo](https://gitlab.utc.fr/damiemar/sy31-projet-tp).
