# Sudoku solver and more

## Academic context

This project had been realized with Hoang Quoc Trung for the course *Problem solving and logic programming*. The objective was to write a *Prolog* program allowing to generate, play and solve a sudoku grid. Note that we were not allowed to use Constraint programming.

## Results

We created the following features:
* Generate grids with several difficulty levels
* Play manually
* Solve wholly or partly the grid
* Import and export grids

The whole project is available and documented on this [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.utc.fr/hoangquo/ia02-sudoku). 

## Technology
* Prolog
