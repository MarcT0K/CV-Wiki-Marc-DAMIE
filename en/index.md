# Presentation


## Who am I?

I am a forth-year Computer Science student in the [University of Technology of Compiègne (UTC)](https://www.utc.fr/en.html); member of [Sorbonne University Alliance](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/university/about-us/sorbonne-university-alliance). 

I am passionate about Data and Cybersecurity. Thanks to projects and student associations I am involved in, I have little experiences in several IT fields: networks, systems, data analysis, image processing, etc.

## What am I currently doing? Research internship
I am currently doing a research internship in the [cybersecurity group of the University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/scs/). I am working on attacking Searchable Encryption using Machine Learning techniques.

## What's next?
Next year, I'll find my Master degree in the University of Technology of Compiègne. Then, I would like to start a PhD focused on Federated Learning.
