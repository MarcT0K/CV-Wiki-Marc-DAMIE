# Presentation


## Who am I?

I am a third-year Computer Science student (equivalent to the canadian *bachelor* last year) in the [University of Technology of Compiègne (UTC)](https://www.utc.fr/en.html); member of the [Sorbonne Univerity Alliance](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/university/about-us/sorbonne-university-alliance). 

I am passionate about Data and Mathematics. Thanks to projects and student associations I am involved in, I have little experiences in several IT fields: networks, systems, data analysis, image processing, etc.

## Development internship
I am currently looking for a 6-month development internship to start my fourth year of studies as well. I would love to find this internship in Montréal, QC.
