# Presentation


## Who am I?

I am a forth-year Computer Science student in the [University of Technology of Compi√®gne (UTC)](https://www.utc.fr/en.html); member of [Sorbonne University Alliance](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/university/about-us/sorbonne-university-alliance). 

I am passionate about Data and Mathematics. Thanks to projects and student associations I am involved in, I have little experiences in several IT fields: networks, systems, data analysis, image processing, etc.

## What am I currently doing? 6-month back-end internship
I am a back-end intern in [Gatewatcher](https://www.gatewatcher.com/en/), a cybersecurity company. I work on the GCenter, a part of the breach detection system Trackwatch which has a security visa from French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI).

My missions are:

* Implementing Django/Flask fonctionnalities
* Creating Python REST APIs
* Developping malware detection and malicious code analysis functions

## What's next? A research internship
I am looking for a research intership starting in February or March. This won't be a part of my study. During the last three years, I have taken a bit more courses than what was necessary. Now, I have more credits than what would be expected. Then, I want to spend a gap semester to introduce myself to academic research.

I would like to do this research projet/placement in a **dutch university**. In a perfect world, I would work on *data/computational pricavy* problems.
